# Person Removal from your videos, or as I have joked about this 'unfollow' your self.
We've all seen Google Maps where the products remove all people from the street views.   This is what this project attempts to accomplish using Apache TensorFlow Javascript. 

## This project.

In using TensorFlow Javascript this small javascript file will programmatically remove persons from a second live video stream.  
Tghis masking is accompished in real-time as the video is 'recorded' from your system's web cam.


## As seen on Twitter

This have bee posted on Twitter @douglasahlquist.    As a favor retweet or add your over video of you masking out 

Feel free to use in your own projects. Code is released under Apache licence. If you decide to use my code please consider giving me a shout out! Would love to see what others create with it :-) Thanks.
